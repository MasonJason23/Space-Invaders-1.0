### Animation Information

Animations were done via creating multiple materials in which has a texture. This texture has multiple images on them. Hence why mutiple materials is used for animations in the game.

Each Texture has multiple images, so each of the materials has a specific tiling size and offset to create the animation clips in the `Animations` folder.

I don't think it is conventional to do like so but I am currently at a point where I can't turn back and redo all of my animation work. In addition, when making changes to animations, a lot of work would have to be done to make these changes.

When creating animations, rather than using an offset of an animation sheet to get each individual image. Create multiple images from the animation sheet and save them as images to be used for animating.
